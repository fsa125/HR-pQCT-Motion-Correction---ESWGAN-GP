% The main.m script simulates synthetic motion in HR-pQCT scans.
%
% Usage Instructions:
% 1. Extract the HR-pQCT DICOM/ISQ files.
% 2. Move the motion-free images you want to use as ground truth (Ys)
%    into the `samples/input` directory (or the desired input folder).
% 3. In the main.m file, set `input_directory` to the folder containing the ground-truth images.
% 4. In the main.m file set `output_directory` to the folder where the motion-corrupted images
%    (Xs) will be saved.
% 5. Run "main.m"
% 
% The script processes the source ground-truth images and generates
% corresponding motion-degraded images, which are saved automatically in
% the specified output directory.
