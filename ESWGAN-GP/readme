This is the official implementation of ESWGAN-GP, ESWGAN-GPv1, and ESWGAN-GPv2

#Step 1: Ordering the files in the directory

archive ---------> Ground truth images all in one folder (sorted) [For example: Dist Rad Train img/img0.png]
        ---------> Motion corrupted images all in one folder (sorted) [For example: Dist Rad Train img sim/img0.png]

saved_models -------> Store the weights of the pre-trained models/storing training weights on the fly


results ----------> Storing predicted images from test.py
